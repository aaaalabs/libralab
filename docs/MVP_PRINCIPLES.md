# LIBRAlab MVP Principles

## Core Philosophy
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Every feature must be as simple as possible while solving the core problem
- **MVP First**: Build the minimum viable product before adding complexity
- **Iterative Development**: Start small, gather feedback, improve incrementally

## MVP Features Priority
1. **Essential (Phase 1)**
   - Simple room listing and viewing
   - Basic user authentication
   - Basic room application form
   
2. **Important (Phase 2)**
   - Community profile creation
   - Simple event calendar
   - Basic messaging system
   
3. **Future Enhancement (Phase 3)**
   - DAO integration
   - Reputation system
   - Advanced community features

## Technical Guidelines
1. **Architecture**
   - Use simple, proven technologies
   - Minimize external dependencies
   - Prefer native solutions over complex frameworks

2. **Development Process**
   - Build features incrementally
   - Test core functionality first
   - Document as you go

3. **Code Organization**
   - Keep components small and focused
   - Use clear, descriptive naming
   - Maintain flat hierarchy where possible

## MVP Success Metrics
- Working core features
- User can complete basic tasks
- System is stable and reliable
- Documentation is clear and current

## Decision Making
When adding features or making changes, ask:
1. Is this essential for the MVP?
2. Can this be simplified further?
3. Does this solve a real user need?
4. Can we defer this to a later phase?
