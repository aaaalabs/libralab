What Drives Me
If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I make things happen. My journey began with a simple curiosity - taking apart a computer just to understand how to rebuild it. That same curiosity now drives me to create innovative AI solutions that deliver real business value.

• Business Process Optimization
• Voice AI Implementation
• Strategic Business Transformation
• Technical Account Management
• Team Leadership

Professional Approach
I don't just talk about ideas - I bring them to life. With a background spanning technology, sales, and business development, I combine technical expertise with practical business acumen. My experience in cybersecurity and technical account management has equipped me with a deep understanding of how to align technological solutions with business needs.

As the CEO of AI-Driven, I specialize in:

My expertise lies in bringing order to chaotic change programmes, ensuring they are delivered on time, within scope, and on budget.

➤ WHAT I DO:
In the majority of cases, I join programmes that have already encountered significant challenges. My focus is on implementing the best tools and methods on a priority basis to drive progress and re-energize the programme by achieving quick wins. The planning must add value, and I have successfully managed parallel planning on a large transformation programme, balancing Critical Path plans with Drop Line plans to meet the diverse needs of programme directors and construction company sponsors.

➤ WHO I HELP: 
My extensive experience enables me to adapt quickly to new situations, making me well-suited to organizations of any size across various sectors. Whether it’s a small start-up or a large multinational corporation, I bring a tailored approach to each project.

➤ HOW I DO IT:
•	Assessment and Agreement: Collaborate with the Management team to determine the necessary 
        project controls and their functions.
•	Resource Identification: Identify the people, processes, and tools required to provide the service 
        effectively.
•	Implementation Roadmap: Develop and agree on an implementation roadmap, typically favoring an 
        evolutionary approach over a big bang due to the urgency to get projects back on track.

➤ ACHIEVEMENTS:
Campus Refurbishment: Served as the Lead PMO Planner on a £50M Campus refurbishment project impacting 4,000 people by implementing ratio seating and integrating various technologies and work styles. This project involved coordinating 100+ Agile developers, and I successfully identified a method to halve the programme duration from 4 years to 2 years, saving £8M.

Why Work With Me? 
My approach is client-focused and results-driven. I excel in environments that require strategic planning and agile execution. I am committed to continuous improvement and professional development, actively participating in industry conferences and forums.

From competing in international math competitions to diving into programming, I’ve always been fascinated by how complex problems can be solved with the right logic and tools. This curiosity and drive eventually led me to artificial intelligence, where I discovered a world of potential for transforming businesses.

But I didn’t stop at the technical side. I spent two years in sales and copywriting, sharpening my communication and strategic thinking skills, and learning how to translate complex ideas into solutions that directly impact business growth. These diverse experiences have shaped me into someone who not only understands AI technology but also knows how to apply it strategically to solve real-world problems.

Who Do I Help?
I help small to mid-sized businesses, especially those in e-commerce, retail, and professional services, harness the power of AI to optimize their operations and scale. My clients are forward-thinking companies who want to unlock the full potential of AI but need expert guidance on where and how to implement it effectively.

What Problems Do I Solve?
Many businesses struggle to make the leap from traditional processes to AI-driven solutions. I solve this by:
   -> Integrating AI into existing workflows to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.
   -> Building custom AI solutions—whether it’s predictive analytics, chatbots, or automation tools—that 
   meet your unique needs.
   ->Turning your data into actionable insights that help you make faster, smarter decisions.

How Do I Solve It?
I combine my technical skills with a business-first approach. Using tools like large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, I create solutions that:
   -> Automate customer service tasks, reducing overhead while boosting customer satisfaction.
   -> Analyze data to help businesses anticipate trends and optimize decision-making.
   -> Personalize customer experiences, driving engagement and loyalty.

My Approach:
Client-Centric Focus: Your unique business challenges are my top priority.
Innovation & Efficiency: I’m committed to building solutions that streamline your operations while staying adaptable to future needs.
Security & Reliability: Every project I work on is thoroughly tested to ensure the highest standards of security and reliability.

Instead AI takes away the busywork, connecting you with red-hot leads who are practically begging to chat with you

That's the future of sales I'm building 🚀.

I'm obsessed with the intersection of AI and human connection ❤️, and how massive the impact could be of AI Sales Bots on businesses.

Literally clicking a few buttons and getting Qualified Leads straight into your pipeline, because let’s face it...

“Cold Calling is the hardest way to get the easiest clients” (Some Sales guru maybe 🤷‍♂️)

But the rejections and the time to dial leads ruins the joy of doing so 😩,

So imagine if you only have to talk to leads that are ready to hand out their credit cards 💳, the moment they get the chance to do so 💥.

It could help you to:

✅ Say goodbye to wasted time: AI handles the heavy lifting, so you can focus on closing deals, not chasing dead ends.
📈 Stop the script shuffle: Forget generic pitches. AI personalizes outreach for maximum impact.
🔥 Unleash the lead gen beast: Identify and connect with red-hot prospects who are ready to do business.
😴 Sleep soundly, sell smarter: knowing AI is working tirelessly for you 24/7.

I'm here to help you ditch the cold calling blues 🎤 and ignite your sales pipeline with qualified prospects.

Ready to ditch the script and spark real conversations? Let's chat!

Here are a few examples of my work:
• Piloted creation of new escrow wallet for Indonesian merchants using Go, gRPC, and Kafka, leading 2 engineers, achieving $44M+ yearly payment volume growth.
• Championed expansion of Direct Debit payments product into Thailand using Go, Node.js, and RabbitMQ, leading 3 engineers, achieving $30M+ monthly payment volume growth.
• Built a scalable credentials management system using Go and AWS KMS, reducing manual ops work from 1.5 hours to 5 minutes.

I also get enthusiastic about opportunities where I pragmatically solve large-scale problems, lead highly-creative engineers, and design data-intensive applications that will impact customers positively.

She was upwind of rapidly growing wildfire–on ""Set"" status, ready to evacuate–when she sent me a picture of the rising column of smoke. Sitting behind my work computer, and a three-hour drive away, I was helpless to do anything to assist.

That day led me to make a major career change. I realized my earlier background as a wildland firefighter might be combined with my software engineering experience and leadership skills to make a difference in we deal with wildfire risk. I wanted to change how people prepare their families, homes, and businesses for fire, to prevent and mitigate loss and damage–to create fire resilient communities.

The question was how. I set out on a quest to figure out how I would move from the field of healthcare data and analytics, back into the world of wildland fire. This time, I would use my fire science training and firefighting experience to assess risk and prevent fire, rather than to suppress fire after it had already begun.

I studied drone technology, geospatial data and analysis, and how to build climate resilience; I practiced my piloting skills and talked with people in across a number of related fields. And in July of 2023, I officially launched Fireflight, LLC, https://www.fireflight.pro.","[""{\""name\"":\""Risk Management\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Fire Prevention Plans\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Machine Learning\"",\""endorsements\"":41}"",""{\""name\"":\""Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"",\""endorsements\"":21}"",""{\""name\"":\""Deep Learning\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Data Analytics\"",\""endorsements\"":41}"",""{\""name\"":\""Workload Prioritization\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Risk Assessment\"",\""endorsements\"":107}"",""{\""name\"":\""Wildfire Mitigation\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Sensors\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Operations\"",\""endorsements\"":107}"",""{\""name\"":\""Flights\"",\""endorsements\"":107}"",""{\""name\"":\""FAA\"",\""endorsements\"":107}"",""{\""name\"":\""Aviation\"",\""endorsements\"":107}"",""{\""name\"":\""Equipment Maintenance\"",\""endorsements\"":21}"",""{\""name\"":\""Data Validation\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Communication\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Geospatial Data\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""ArcGIS Pro\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Drones\"",\""endorsements\"":107}"",""{\""name\"":\""Environmental Data\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Remote Sensing\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Drone Piloting\"",\""endorsements\"":107}"",""{\""name\"":\""Climate Resilience\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Data Analysis and Mapping\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Web Development\"",\""endorsements\"":4}"",""{\""name\"":\""Web Design\"",\""endorsements\"":2}"",""{\""name\"":\""Data Visualization\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Project Management\"",\""endorsements\"":3}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Intelligence\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Data Analysis\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Agile Development\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Front-end Development\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Software development\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Web Applications\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""User Interface Design\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""User Experience\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Javascript\"",\""endorsements\"":2}"",""{\""name\"":\""Tableau\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""MySQL\"",\""endorsements\"":63}"",""{\""name\"":\""PostgreSQL\"",\""endorsements\"":53}"",""{\""name\"":\""Linux\"",\""endorsements\"":74}"",""{\""name\"":\""Python\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Adobe Photoshop\"",\""endorsements\"":32}"",""{\""name\"":\""Adobe Illustrator\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Git\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Microsoft Excel\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Leadership\"",\""endorsements\"":6}"",""{\""name\"":\""Problem Solving\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Public Speaking\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Design Thinking\"",\""endorsements\"":0}""]","[""{\""title\"":\""Wildland Fire Mitigation Specialist & sUAS Pilot\"",\""company\"":\""FireFlight, LLC\"",\""date_range\"":\""Feb 2023 -

Visual Basic Applications (VBA) — We have a proven track record of using VBA to develop tailored solutions that meet our clients' unique needs, consistently delivering results that exceed expectations.

AI-Based Applications — Leveraging large language models and AI tools, we build customized solutions that transform tedious, time-consuming tasks into seamless processes.

Software Implementation — While our small business clients are highly capable, they often lack the in-house resources to manage commercial off-the-shelf software implementations.

Let me show you my path from concept to competition champion and then founding a startup:

-Buried in paperwork, I began diving into automation 👇
-Turned complex processes into simple workflows at a startup

Then came the twist. 🌪️

-Automated an Airbnb management process 👇
-Won $15.000 for my idea

That was my lightbulb moment. 💡

And that’s how a startup was born.

Rise n Rest is built on my 3 key takeaways:

–› A well-designed AI Assistant can be trusted
–› A well-crafted system creates better content than you
–› A well-tailored automation is an investment in freedom

I believe in deliberately creating the life you want. That’s why I choose work that challenges me and have (so far) lived and worked remotely from these countries: 🇨🇦 🇵🇹 🇫🇷 🇮🇹 🇷🇴 🇺🇸 🇩🇴 🇦🇷 🇲🇪 🇧🇦 🇪🇸

My experiences thus far have been gratifying and the successes/failures have taught me many lessons. Here are a few:

(1) I am capable of taking new businesses from zero to one
	> The result feels amazing, but the creation satisfies me most
	> If you don’t have leverage, volume works too
	> It’s a combination of art and science

(2) I can successfully lead teams of up to 23
	> I hire people who can do the job better than I can
	> I understand that culture is set at the top
	> “It’s the people, stupid.”

(3) My biggest strength is systemizing and automating
        > It reduced my work time by 81%
        > Long-term time savings require time and money invested
        > I'm adept at identifying bottlenecks and designing scalable systems

(4) My obsession with learning is my greatest asset
	> A meaningful portion of my day is dedicated to learning from the best
	> It has resulted in higher-quality decision-making
	> It allows me to stay calm under pressure

(5) Be picky about who you take on as clients
	> They must be serious about investing in quality solutions
	> I must be able to genuinely help them
	> They must have good intentions

Whether it be the need to transition towards more agile ways of working, identifying and breaking down silos, right down to writing those first company documents defining a new process to scale company operations.

If you're a small business owner, here's how I can help you:

→ Transform your small business through powerful AI solutions.
→ Automate your workflow to save time and reduce costs.
→ Use AI Tools to boost your business's productivity and profitability.

-----

Here’s a little more about me:

I'm enrolled in the University of Arizona's Eller College of Business, studying Finance. 

At the start of my Sophomore year of college, I started a short-form content creation agency.

Here's a summary of what I was able to accomplish with that agency:

→ My best-performing client brought in ~500,000 views in 3 months across all their social media profiles, from SCRATCH, just through short-form content. 
→ I generated 156,000 Views, 3,095 likes, 1,354 comments, & 326 profile views on a new client TikTok profile in under 60 days.
→ I scaled my company to $3K MRR, completely independently.

Now, I'm dedicated to providing AI automation solutions to small business owners all around the US.

-----

Anyone who's been remotely in tune with what's happening in the world right now can see the impact AI is having on everybody.

ESPECIALLY in the business space.

Businesses that don't take advantage of the current AI revolution will fall behind in efficiency, decision-making, customer satisfaction, cost management, innovation, and overall competitiveness.

That's why I decided to leave my content creation agency behind and pursue opportunities in the AI space.

So I could help small business owners create long-lasting success for their businesses by harnessing the power of AI technology.

If you’re looking to be the author of your own personal or business journal, look no further than our free Preserver App! It’s easy to use and requires no registration. It does no tracking of your activity, and we monetize it with small banner ads so you don’t have to pay a cent.

► With the Preserver App, you can record your life’s events, your hobbies, your work, or anything else you want, in any, or all mediums, whether it’s through text, audio, pictures, or video. Plus, there are no pesky in-app purchases to worry about. All entries are location, date and time stamped, and securely stored in your personal cloud account in a convenient calendar format.

You are always in control of your personal data.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Preserver allows you to capture multiple types of observations to comprise an “activity”.
These observations automatically include the geographic location, start and end times, but you can also add text, photos, audio, and even a 30 second video or two (or more!). Speech to text? It’s built in.
The “activity” consists of your acquired observations which can be collectively uploaded to a secure environment in the cloud, can prove your involvement in that activity, and might even protect you against inaccurate claims.

► Who’s it for? Everyone! Remote workers, tradespeople, aged carers, youth workers, allied health professionals, babysitters, family members, and almost anyone else who wishes to record evidence-based proof that they were responsibly carrying out an Activity. Find out more.  Contact details below.

A week of interviews wasted.

Everyone that’s come through the door is just not quite right.

And you’re stressing over all the workload you can’t delegate.

Clients are getting frustrated at late project delivery.

You’re having to apologise over and over.

But it won’t cut it.

If only you could find that golden team player.

One that would pick up the slack.

Then your clients’ happy faces would come back.

Your revenue would get back to those levels.

Your confidence would skyrocket.

You’d go back to your element and focus on sales.

Well, the good news is, this is where I come in.

👋 Hey, I’m Cheryl.

Recruiter, Media creator and ex- TV presenter/Producer - I'm also the person who interviewed Sylvester Stallone and told him he wasn't as good looking as me - debatable, some might say! 

After 18 years in the industry as Head of Television and Producer/Director I set up my micro-niche recruitment agency - Media Meerkat Ltd.

We find the absolute best talent in the Media/TV Production and Advertising/creative agency industries in the UK.

Following on from the success of this agency, I went on to launch Talent Meerkat - finding superstars in Sales and Marketing, Digital marketing across multiple industries.


PS. There’s 2 ways I can help you.

If you’re looking to:

1. Source your next dream team member for your Creative Agency.

2. Looking for mentorship on how to do the talent sourcing yourself

And the best part? 

We've managed to get it down to an exact science that can be used by anyone, anywhere in order to achieve complete time, location, and financial freedom. 

I'll make videos that cover

1. How to build a 6 or 7-figure agency (without losing your mind)
2. How to nail your niche, create irresistible offers, and charge premium prices 
3. How to get 5, 10, even 20 new high paying clients every single month 
4. Strategies to help you use your agency to fund your dreams

We're also on the lookout for any agency owners who have built agencies and want to share their stories too.

See, A.I. doesn't just save you time - it multiplies it.

You can not only generate more revenue and get more clients because of the insights, messaging, and accuracy that A.I. can provide you at impossibly fast rates of speed...

...it also allows you to take all that time you save to then focus on more income-producing activities, like talking to more humans.

We're not even accounting for ""cutting overhead,"" here.

Not to mention opportunity costs...

If your hourly rate is $100 (easy math), and you save 10 hours with A.I....

That's $1,000 saved PLUS another 10 hours to go make another $1,000.

It compounds.

Think it's too good to be true?

How long would it take you to write a highly persuasive, 5-email campaign that converts?

I'm talking subject line, preview text, message body, closing comments, call to action...images...

AT LEAST an hour, right? Very likely much more, for most.

With A.I, you can do it in 5 minutes.

If you're like many people and not even sending emails because copywriters are expensive and doing it yourself is overwhelming, think of the opportunity cost of not nurturing your list...

Of course, A.I. goes so much deeper than ""writing some emails.""

If you want to see A.I. in action...

If you want to learn how A.I. and automation can scale your business...

I invite you to Message me ""A.I.

Tired of those repetitive, time-consuming 50-step tasks that distract you from revenue-generating activities?

Frustrated with running ad campaigns for months with no tangible results?

Struggling with your team dropping the ball on collecting contacts or following up?

My journey into the world of business and marketing started young, watching my father lose his business due to a lack of understanding about driving traffic. This early experience shaped my perspective profoundly. Fast forward to my days running a promotion company in the fiercely competitive nightlife industry, where I learned the hard-core reality of ROI.

Then, in 2018, everything changed when my business coach taught me the game-changing potential of automation and platform integration, famously saying, “You can't take likes to the bank.”

At this point, I've:
Successfully advertised and promoted over 500+ events through social media.

Developed unique methods to track and show how much customers spent from social media for my clients.

Helped numerous small businesses soar to 7 figures annually through savvy online marketing.

I remember my father's daily struggle with customers and his challenges in maintaining consistency and scaling his business. That's why I am so passionate about AI automation and using AI agents to help my clients succeed.

At Mcube Labs, we specialize in AI Automation Marketing focused on ROI, not just awareness.

Here's what we've achieved for our clients:
For Bacchus of Lebanon, we not only exploded their local brand using our Brand Rich strategy, we increased their Instagram followers by 7x in under 9 months and also improved their Google ranking 20 spots up using an AI Agent.

Itadi Body saw nearly $50k in online sales from just one 16 sec advertisement, optimized for converting new customers.

Mad Cow Grill launched a social media ad campaign that generated $75 in sales on day 1, over 700 customer emails by day 30, and projected annual revenue of $30k with just a $250 budget.

I have a strong emphasis on building projects that are robust and properly constructed, bringing together partners that by working harmoniously together, deliver propositions that create value over the long-term.

I have been in the financial services sector throughout my career, predominantly as an entrepreneur and innovator. I am passionate about new technologies which are changing the world, and I strongly believe that everyone should embrace, rather than be wary of them.

In 2019 I was a consultant to a new decentralized social media platform. During lockdown, I traded cryptocurrencies, during which I experienced my fair share of scams and rug pulls. But by limiting risk and taking profits, I was able to make a strong overall return.

Today I am part of a volunteer marketing team for a decentralized finance project and remain an investor in this emerging asset class.

I launched Cryptocurrency Simplified to educate people that they too, can make returns, by implementing informed selection and timing. At the very least, you will gain an understanding of this new technology, putting you ahead of the herd and in a position to discuss the subject knowledgeably.

I spent 20 years in the London insurance market before leaving to establish PatientChoice as an alternative approach to conventional private medical insurance, known as Hospital Treatment Plans. PatientChoice won several industry awards and was sold to Westfield Health in 2011.

selfinsurancemarket.com provides information to current and future self-insurers in an easy to follow format, as well as providing listings of the service providers who can assist companies who wish to become self-insured.

I have also created a new protection approach known as Medical Recovery Insurance. The product was the recipient of the Cover Excellence 2013 Specialist / Innovative Product of the Year Award and this concept is now in the process of being exported overseas in a partnership with Aon.

I have designed and managed the build of several websites for businesses including www.crewsure.com and www.candgregroup.com

2012 – I was asked to stand-in as Treasurer for the Horsham District Neighborhood Watch Association whilst a permanent replacement was found following the resignation of the previous office holder.

I thrive in early-stage environments where collaboration and building from the ground up create unique opportunities to drive value and innovation.

My expertise lies in fostering teamwork and adopting methodologies like extreme programming to optimize productivity and quality. I am an advocate of test-driven development, focusing on building robust, maintainable solutions. My core tools include Node.js and Golang, though I’m always eager to explore new technologies and approaches.

Throughout my career, I’ve been part of several successful startups and even launched one of my own. I discovered a passion for being the first engineer after the CTO, where I focus on establishing technical foundations, shaping company culture, and driving both engineering and product development.

My consulting experience has broadened my perspective, exposing me to diverse industries such as autonomous vehicles, design software, SaaS startups, and digital agencies. I’ve worked across the entire stack, including front-end, back-end, DevOps, and databases, enabling me to adapt to a wide range of challenges.

My goal is to help businesses scale their operations and HR functions by implementing cutting-edge AI solutions. Leveraging tools like Voice flow, Make.com, RelevanceAI, Airtable, Veed.io, and more, I enable businesses to streamline their processes, enhance productivity, and reduce operational costs.

Here’s How I Can Help:
🤖 AI Intelligence:

AI Assistants can revolutionize your customer service by providing instant, 24/7 responses to customer inquiries.
Using Voice flow, I can design and deploy a chatbot that handles customer queries, processes orders, and provides personalized recommendations, all while freeing up your staff to focus on more complex tasks.

📅 AI Appointment Setters:

Streamlining appointment scheduling can significantly reduce administrative workload.
By integrating tools like Make.com and Airtable, I can set up an AI appointment setter that manages your calendar, books meetings, sends reminders, and handles rescheduling, ensuring a seamless experience for your clients and a more efficient use of your time.

✍️ AI Content Generators:

Creating high-quality content is crucial for engaging your audience and maintaining an active online presence.
With the help of RelevanceAI and Veed.io, I can implement AI content generators that produce blog posts, social media updates, video scripts, and more. This ensures a consistent flow of fresh content without the constant time investment from your team.

Examples of Implementations:

-> Customer Support Automation:

A mid-sized e-commerce business integrated an AI chatbot to handle customer inquiries about order status, returns, and product details.
Result: 40% reduction in response times and a significant improvement in customer satisfaction.
Appointment Scheduling for a Clinic:

-> A small healthcare clinic implemented an AI appointment setter that managed patient bookings and sent automated reminders.
Result: Reduced no-show rates by 30% and freed up staff to focus on patient care.
Content Creation for a Marketing Agency:

-> A marketing agency utilized AI content generators to produce blog posts and social media content.
Result: 50% increase in output and more engagement from their audience. 

-> Businesses can automate responses to their customers reviews

How I got into artificial intelligence
Late summer 2022, my daughter excitedly shared a video of robotic dolls. I didn't understand AI and its different uses. In short, I was skeptical and terrified of AI, I didn't even use ChatGPT. 

A while after, a friend shared some insights that made me curious. I started researching online, reading widely, talking with others in the space, getting certified and the more I learned, the more I grew to understand Artificial Intelligence better. 

I haven't been more excited about how not only Generative AI but other types of AI can save us time and simplify life.","[""{\""name\"":\""Communication\"",\""endorsements\"":101}"",""{\""name\"":\""Problem Solving\"",\""endorsements\"":101}"",""{\""name\"":\""Product Strategy\"",\""endorsements\"":32}"",""{\""name\"":\""Product Vision\"",\""endorsements\"":21}"",""{\""name\"":\""P&L Management\"",\""endorsements\"":21}"",""{\""name\"":\""Workflow Automation\"",\""endorsements\"":21}"",""{\""name\"":\""Product Road Mapping\"",\""endorsements\"":86}"",""{\""name\"":\""Cross-functional Team Leadership\"",\""endorsements\"":76}"",""{\""name\"":\""Emerging Trends\"",\""endorsements\"":119}"",""{\""name\"":\""New Business Opportunities\"",\""endorsements\"":43}"",""{\""name\"":\""Presentations\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Chatbot Development\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Natural Language Processing (NLP)\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Financial Accounting\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Management Accounting\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Financial Reporting\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Marketing Strategy\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Sales Strategy\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Team Leadership\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Generative AI\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Artificial Neural Networks\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Start-up Leadership\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Ownership\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Start-up Ventures\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""User Experience (UX)\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Ingredient Analysis\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Formulation Chemistry\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Wellness Coaching\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""IT Business Analysis\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""User Stories\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""E-Commerce\"",\""endorsements\"":21}"",""{\""name\"":\""Strategic Planning\"",\""endorsements\"":6}"",""{\""name\"":\""Strategy\"",\""endorsements\"":27}"",""{\""name\"":\""Analysis\"",\""endorsements\"":21}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Strategy\"",\""endorsements\"":13}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Analysis\"",\""endorsements\"":32}"",""{\""name\"":\""Change Management\"",\""endorsements\"":9}"",""{\""name\"":\""Management Consulting\"",\""endorsements\"":9}"",""{\""name\"":\""Risk Management\"",\""endorsements\"":4}"",""{\""name\"":\""Management\"",\""endorsements\"":9}"",""{\""name\"":\""Team Management\"",\""endorsements\"":2}""]","[""{\""title\"":\""AI Lead | Senior Business Analyst | Gen AI Advisor\"",\""company\"":\""The Economist\"",\""date_range\"":\""Aug 2023 -

In 2020, I had my first internship, which sparked my enthusiasm for business and innovation. During this time, I created my first systems and automation, realizing their incredible potential.

After five internships, during which I explored everything from Facebook ads to email marketing and social media management, I discovered my true passion: Automation. 

It never felt like work; it was pure joy.

I soon realized that customized systems and automation are crucial for saving time, reducing costs, and streamlining operations.

In May 2023, I launched AutomateMyBiz, a marketing automation agency in Dubai. 

Since then, I've helped over 50 businesses scale through custom systems and automation.

Highlights of My Work:

→Saved Over $1 Million: Reduced client labor costs by over $1 million.
→Saved 60,000 Hours: Eliminated manual tasks, saving clients over 60,000 hours.
→Extensive Automation: Developed 5500+ automations and implemented 50+ CRM & Project Management Systems.
→Increased Conversions: Helped clients achieve 5-10x increases in conversions through intelligent automation and funnels.

I've worked with Some of the top names in various industries, including NasAcademy, LawByMike, Ugo Lord, Anthony O'Neil, and WeBuildCoaches. (one of my favorite creators even reached out to me in early 2024 for collaboration; it was Ali Abdaal)

Specializations:

→Marketing Automation
→Business Process Automation
→Marketing Operations/CRM Implementation
→AI Solutions & Chatbots

Tools I Specialize In:

HubSpot (Certified), ActiveCampaign (Agency Partner), GoHighLevel (SaaS Partner), Zoho, Notion, Monday, MailChimp, ManyChat, Zapier, MAKE.com, Pabbly, Axiom.ai

A nevem Kiss Zoltán, és nem csupán egy vállalkozás vezetője vagyok, hanem egy elkötelezett innovátor, akinek szenvedélye az AI technológiákban rejlő lehetőségek maximális kihasználása a Magyarországi vállalkozások megsegítésére. Ezért hoztam létre az AI ügynökségemet, a SpixarAI-t, amelynek fő küldetése, hogy a legkorszerűbb AI autómatizációs megoldásokkal és intelligens asszisztensekkel segítsem a vállalkozásokat a növekedés útján.


Mi motivál engem?

Az én történetem az emberekről és az ő kihívásaikról szól. Láttam, hogy a vállalkozások nap mint nap milyen terhekkel küzdenek – a végtelen adminisztratív feladatok, a folyamatos ügyfélszolgálati igények, a növekvő piaci verseny és a marketing erőfeszítések szinte lehetetlen iramú növekedése. Tudom, hogy mindezek a kihívások milyen mértékben terhelik meg az embereket és a vállalkozásokat. Az én célom, hogy ezen a terhen könnyítsek. Hiszek abban, hogy az AI technológia nem csupán egy eszköz, hanem egy erőteljes partner lehet az emberek életében, amely lehetővé teszi, hogy visszanyerjék a fókuszt arra, ami igazán fontos számukra.


Mivel foglalkozom?

Az általam vezetett AI ügynökség az AI autómatizációk és AI asszisztensek területén tevékenykedik. Olyan megoldásokat fejlesztünk, amelyek a vállalkozások számára lehetőséget biztosítanak arra, hogy hatékonyabban működjenek, csökkentsék a költségeiket, és növeljék a bevételeiket. Minden egyes projekt mögött az a cél húzódik, hogy valós, mérhető eredményeket érjünk el, miközben tehermentesítjük az ügyfeleinket a hétköznapi feladatoktól, és újraélesztjük bennük a szenvedélyt, amiért annak idején vállalkozásba kezdtek.


Miért vagyok itt?

Azért vagyok itt, hogy kapcsolatot teremtsünk. Azért, hogy együtt dolgozzunk azon, hogy a vállalkozásod ne csak túléljen, hanem virágozzon is ebben a gyorsan változó világban. Hiszek abban, hogy az együttműködés és a közös munka révén képesek vagyunk bármilyen kihívást leküzdeni.

Keress bátran, és kezdjük el ma a jövő építését!
Nincs vesztenivalód, csak nyerhetsz egy megbízható partnerrel és innovatív AI megoldásokkal. Lépj kapcsolatba velem, és beszéljük meg, hogyan vihetnénk előre a vállalkozásodat!","[""SaaS Sales"","" Software as a Service (SaaS)"","" Marketing Automation"","" Artificial Intelligence (AI)"","" Marketing"","" Social Media Marketing"","" Sales"","" Project Management""]","[""Company Owner at SpixarAI (Jun 2024 - Present) "",""Ingatlan értékesítési szakértő at Self-employed (Jan 2017 - Present) "",""Real Estate Agent at TOP3 Ingatlan (Feb 2014 - Dec 2016)""]","[""-""]",0,"[""""]","[""""]",2024-09-05 04:51:11.246317+00,2024-10-26 14:16:41.326+00,,18.9529586,47.4621396,https://ik.imagekit.io/libralab/AAA/Avatars/Map/izoltan-kiss

With a keen eye for identifying opportunities, my business partner and I led our digital marketing agency to the prestigious INC 500 list, and eventually orchestrated a successful exit through a strategic acquisition.

Not one to rest on my laurels, I went on to establish a thriving e-commerce retail store, which I grew to over $3 million in sales within just two years before selling. My innate ability to identify market trends and leverage cutting-edge strategies has cemented my reputation as a true business trailblazer (hopefully).

Eager to learn, I am open to wisdom from any source, at any time. I firmly embrace the notion that the most beneficial feedback is often negative, as it drives improvement and growth. Moreover, I subscribe to the belief that luck is the intersection where preparation meets opportunity.

🎓 I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Auckland University of Technology in 2020. During my studies, my interest shifted towards software, so I taught myself to code while completing my degree.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 After university, I found myself drawn into the Web3 space during the NFT bull run. I ditched my mechanical engineering career and took the plunge as an entrepreneur, freelancing and contracting as a Community Manager and Content Strategist for several Web3 companies and projects.

⌛ I also explored several startup opportunities, most notably Unison, a Web3 multi-chain wallet that enabled seamless asset bridging across chains. Unfortunately, it didn’t succeed.

💻 Fast forward to 2024, and I’ve been working as a Frontend Developer for Morningside AI for over a year.

Ik specialiseer me in de toepassing van AI, AI Assistants en Automatisering voor Software bedrijven en dienstverleners.

In de zomer van 2022 ben ik voor een Artificial Intelligence summer course naar het buitenland geweest. Ik kwam hier in contact met inspirerende mensen en heeft mij laten inzien hoe AI op veel veschillende manieren de dagelijkse werkzaamheden kan ondersteunen en van waarde kan zijn binnen bedrijven.

Ik ben mij naderhand gaan focussen op de toepassing van AI, AI Assistents en realiseerde me dat AI, AI Assistants en Automatisering niet alleen zorgen voor operationele efficiëntie, maar ook een boost kunnen geven aan het plezier op de werkvloer. Door saaie repeterende taken te automatiseren worden er minder fouten gemaakt en houden medewerkers meer tijd over om zich te richten op de werkzaamheden die persoonlijke aandacht nodig hebben.

Ik help jou de mogelijkheden en kansen voorAI, AI Assistants en Automatisering binnen jouw organisatie te ontdekken en te benutten. Nadat er samen is bepaald hoe dit het meest van waarde kan zijn, gaat BlueBirdz aan de slag met het bouwen, testen en opleveren van de gewenste oplossing.

Een aantal veel gebruikte toepassingen van AI Assistants zijn:
-	Prospecting assistant (Sales & Marketing)
-	Customer Support assistant (Klantenservice)
-	Interne Communicatie assistant (Interne Communicatie)
-	Onboarding assistant (Onboarding van klanten)
-	Staff Training assistant (Inwerken medewerkers)

My journey has been marked by an unwavering commitment to my craft despite grappling with the challenges of an atypical neurotype. As an author, composer, and creative visionary, I have forged a path that showcases both resilience and artistic prowess.

I’m designing a Second Brain and Second Self so that long term I can access and manage my multi-passionate generalist lifestyle with increasingly powerful AIs as they are developed.

I happen to be a talented world builder and storyteller with a lot of soul, all things which I think are core competitive advantages in the AI paradigm shift. When everyone can do this stuff easily, what will distinguish you is what makes you unique, and what makes you human. One, other people can’t replicate, and the other, AI can’t do! Seems solid to me.

I have a long view of my creative role in the future, and know an opportunity when I see it. I have a visionary mindset, a knack for strategic planning and systems design. I see the big picture, and the tiny fundamentals very easily, and can generally zoom in on any parts in between because I have learned how to learn.

In 2014, I ventured into the realm of music composition, earning recognition from the legendary Richard Garriott, known as Lord British, creator of the Ultima series. Under his patronage, I became a bard in my own right, composing music for ""Shroud of the Avatar"" and even forming a Guild of musicians with a Royal Warrant.

My musical achievements also include the creation of the celebrated album ""Rune Songs for the 21st Century"" and the development of close to 100 songs for Embers Adrift (Stormhaven Studios), a testament to my evolving creative range.

My journey is a testament to my unyielding dedication to the arts, and I invite you to explore my professional endeavors further by dropping me a line!

Mi camino me llevó al fascinante mundo de la inteligencia artificial, donde vi una oportunidad revolucionaria con la llegada de ChatGPT.

Me di cuenta del impacto que la IA tendría en las empresas y me sumergí en su estudio, desarrollando automatizaciones y soluciones de IA que optimizan procesos en empresas y firmas legales. Desde entonces, no he parado de innovar en este campo.

A los 15 años también empecé a estudiar el sistema educativo porque nunca me sentí a gusto en él. Siempre supe que mi verdadero aprendizaje ocurría fuera de las instituciones. En 2023, el mismo año en que ingresé a la universidad, decidí abandonarla para seguir mi pasión por la IA, convencido de que el sistema educativo tradicional y la estructura no es compatible con los emprendedores porque directamente ahoga el alma y el motor del emprendedor, la creatividad.

Hoy, trabajo con un equipo talentoso en IA, dedicándome a lo que más me apasiona.

Scoping and understanding clients’ needs and preferences are pivotal and at the forefront of what we do in order to provide an extremely personable service tailored to the individual and or business we are working on behalf of.

Although I thrive in making my customers happy, and satisfied, when I can outside of work, I am an avid football fan, having played a lot of football in my teen years, I have learnt about the importance of team building, working in a group and being a captain or leader and leading by example at every opportunity.

→ Expertise, um KI für maximalen Impact zu nutzen, ohne Buzzword-Schnickschnack.


😉 Hier komme ich ins Spiel.

Ich bin deine Ansprechpartnerin für KI-Strategien. 

Als Unternehmerin und ehemalige Tech- und Business-Consultant kenne ich deine Herausforderungen. „Ich fühl dich“, wie Gen Z sagen würde. 😄

Ich übersetze Buzzwords und Komplexität in einfache, wirkungsvolle Lösungen für dein Business.


📌 Die Zusammenarbeit mit mir kann so aussehen:

→ Strategie-Workshops: Wo kannst Du KI nutzen, um deine Arbeitsbelastung zu reduzieren.

→ Coaching: Individuelle Unterstützung, um diese Lösungen nahtlos zu implementieren.

→ Kurse: Löse spezifische Herausforderungen in deinem Business-Alltag mit KI, zB.

— Ziehe die richtigen Kunden mit deinem Content an
— Schaffe Brand Awareness auf LinkedIn
— Optimiere dein Marketing oder CRM
— Steigere deine Lead-Generierung
— Baue/optimiere deine Website
— Erstelle deinen Newsletter
— Generiere mehr Sales

… es geht einiges! 😄

My journey has taken me across 20+ countries, where I've assisted businesses, government agencies, and destinations to craft strategies that drive economic development, enhance competitiveness, and create sustainable growth.

As the founder of Kaiso, my focus is on leveraging my vast experience in the travel, tourism, and export sectors to help small and medium-sized businesses harness the transformative power of AI. I believe that AI is not optional. It's an absolute necessity. It's the key to unlocking unprecedented growth and efficiency.

Throughout my career, I’ve led initiatives that have shaped national policies, driven export growth, and redefined strategies for tourism destinations around the globe. From developing the National Youth Policy and National Sports Policy for the Cayman Islands in 2024 to crafting the 3-Year Marketing and Communications Strategy for Destination Dominica to assisting The Gambia in developing their National Export Strategy, my work has always centered on driving impact and delivering results.

These experiences have honed my ability to develop tailored solutions that meet the unique needs of each client—whether that means penetrating new markets, enhancing digital presence, or developing cutting-edge marketing strategies.

Now, at Kaiso, I’m channeling this expertise into AI consulting and development. I’m passionate about helping small and medium businesses transition into the AI era, not just to survive but to thrive. My fear is that small and medium businesses will be left behind as AI truly takes off. My mission is to help as many as I can ride this fast-moving AI wave. Whether it’s automating workflows, enhancing customer experiences, boosting sales, or implementing AI-driven strategies, my goal is to empower growing businesses to leverage AI as a competitive advantage.

The world is changing rapidly and radically, and the businesses that will lead are those that embrace innovation, fast. At Kaiso, we're not just offering AI solutions; we're crafting AI-driven transformations that position our clients at the forefront of their industries. My mission is to help businesses navigate this new landscape with confidence, armed with the tools, talent, and strategies they need to succeed.

My entrepreneurial journey kicked off during my gap year in Edinburgh as a way to prove to myself that I could translate my high school success or ‘book smarts’ into ‘real world’ smarts, which to me was being able to make money and not be painfully broke. 

This decision launched me into the world of ecommerce where over 3 years I got the best business crash course a fledging entrepreneur could ask for, dropping out of my business degree along the way. While running my online stores I cut my teeth in the digital marketing space, an invaluable skillset that has been foundational to my “long term” success (I’m 23, only time will tell!).

As the ecommerce headwinds of 2020 battered my business, my mentor Josh Brown offered me a position to join his digital marketing agency JB Media, where I further developed my skillset.

In 2022, I was able to circle back to on an old passion of mine that had been left by the wayside in my pursuit of entrepreneurial success: coding.

Over the next 12 months I taught myself Python specializing in Machine Learning and wrapped up 2022 with my first exposure to language models such as BERT for sentiment analysis tasks. It was at this time I first tried ChatGPT and instantly knew that this was where my focus would be for the coming years.

To dive in head first, I launched my YouTube channel on January 3rd 2023, starting a new chapter in my entrepreneurial journey. My rapid growth led me to founding my own AI Development company Morningside AI, named after the suburb in New Zealand I grew up in.

Since then, I have continued to create content helping entrepreneurs wrap their heads around AI, reaching 116,000 subs as of writing (Nov 2023). This audience allowed me to launch the education arm of Morningside through our flagship product “AAA Accelerator” where we help entrepreneurs to start and scale their own AI Agencies.

What started off as a way to prove to myself that I had ‘real world’ smarts has blossomed into a drive to reach the pinnacle of entrepreneurship by building the world’s leading AI development firm and impact the lives of thousands by making AI education accessible to all.

My mission is to deliver impactful insights and solutions that drive business growth.

My journey into the world of data science is one of curiosity, passion, and continuous learning.

It all started with my Master's studies in Neuroscience, where I delved deep into the intricacies of the brain. This experience wasn't just about understanding one of the most complex entities known to humankind, it was my first real dive into the world of research, statistics, and data analysis.

After my studies, I ventured into the business world as a marketing consultant. It was here that my fascination with data took on a new dimension. I embraced a data-driven approach, applying my analytical skills to solve business challenges. This role deepened my understanding of business dynamics and honed my ability to translate data into strategic decisions.

It was my fascination with deep learning and AI that set the course for the next chapter in my career. The potential of AI to revolutionize industries, from healthcare to finance, and even the way we interact with the world around us, sparked a desire in me to be at the forefront of this transformation. Driven by this passion, I decided to pivot my career towards data science, eager to harness the power of AI and machine learning in solving complex problems.

To equip myself with the necessary skills, I joined Le Wagon bootcamp, an immersive experience that transformed my understanding of data science. It was hands-on, intense, and incredibly rewarding. The bootcamp was more than just learning how to code or use machine learning algorithms, it was about understanding how to leverage data to make better decisions.

Today, as I continue on this journey, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. Whether it's developing innovative solutions, unlocking the potential of data to drive decisions, or contributing to the field of AI, I am committed to making a significant impact. I believe in the power of data to not only inform decisions but to inspire change and foster growth.

Thank you for stopping by my profile.

My expertise lies in bringing order to chaotic change programmes, ensuring they are delivered on time, within scope, and on budget.

➤ WHAT I DO:
In the majority of cases, I join programmes that have already encountered significant challenges. My focus is on implementing the best tools and methods on a priority basis to drive progress and re-energize the programme by achieving quick wins. The planning must add value, and I have successfully managed parallel planning on a large transformation programme, balancing Critical Path plans with Drop Line plans to meet the diverse needs of programme directors and construction company sponsors.

➤ WHO I HELP: 
My extensive experience enables me to adapt quickly to new situations, making me well-suited to organizations of any size across various sectors. Whether it’s a small start-up or a large multinational corporation, I bring a tailored approach to each project.

➤ HOW I DO IT:
•	Assessment and Agreement: Collaborate with the Management team to determine the necessary 
        project controls and their functions.
•	Resource Identification: Identify the people, processes, and tools required to provide the service 
        effectively.
•	Implementation Roadmap: Develop and agree on an implementation roadmap, typically favoring an 
        evolutionary approach over a big bang due to the urgency to get projects back on track.

➤ ACHIEVEMENTS:
Campus Refurbishment: Served as the Lead PMO Planner on a £50M Campus refurbishment project impacting 4,000 people by implementing ratio seating and integrating various technologies and work styles. This project involved coordinating 100+ Agile developers, and I successfully identified a method to halve the programme duration from 4 years to 2 years, saving £8M.

Why Work With Me? 
My approach is client-focused and results-driven. I excel in environments that require strategic planning and agile execution. I am committed to continuous improvement and professional development, actively participating in industry conferences and forums.

Let’s Connect: 
I am passionate about leveraging my skills to drive project success and am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Connect with me to discuss how I can help your organization achieve its project and programme goals.

My aim is to develop solutions that generate real change and enhance the user experience. I'm particularly passionate about new technologies such as Blockchain, AI and Virtual Reality.

I've had the opportunity to take part in several projects that have enabled me to develop solid skills as a Product Manager, while acquiring in-depth knowledge in various fields such as marketing, design, leadership, sales and business. These experiences have given me great agility in interacting and coordinating between different sectors of a company, as well as a natural facility for teamwork, strategic planning and achieving concrete goals.

At Bumps, we thought about the potential functionalities of a platform for freelancers, using Design Thinking and collaborating with them. Although we didn't develop the platform, this in-depth thinking enabled us to understand and respond to many of the issues faced by freelancers, such as collaborating with other freelancers, guaranteeing payment for services and facilitating secure communications with their team or clients. I played a key role in the organization of this project, ensuring coordination between different stakeholders such as UI/UX designers and programmers.

At Vitipact, we're developing a solution to support winegrowers in their agroecological transition and pesticide reduction. Our solution enables them to be recognized for their efforts in terms of environmental and social responsibility. I'm at the heart of the department's improvements, working closely with the various teams. I coordinate and produce designs, videos and service improvements.

I'm always looking for new challenges to shape the future of innovation. I'm convinced of my ability to stimulate creativity, foster collaboration between stakeholders and achieve excellent results. As a dynamic Product Manager, I'm passionate about innovation and constantly on the lookout for new opportunities to deliver exceptional user experiences and drive the industry forward.","[""Agile"","" Leadership"","" Product Led Growth"","" Méthodes agiles"","" Responsabilité"","" Product Management"","" Teamwork"","" Creativity"","" Communication"","" Entrepreneuriat"","" Veille concurrentielle"","" Design"","" Blockchain"","" Gestion de produit"","" Web3"","" Travail d’équipe"","" Études de marché"","" Figma (logiciel)"","" Anglais"","" Espagnol"","" Consulting stratégique"","" Conception web"","" Gestion d’équipe"","" Stratégie marketing"","" Réseaux sociaux"","" Stratégie numérique"","" Facebook Ads"","" Création de contenu pour les médias sociaux"","" Pack Office"","" Marketing sur les médias sociaux"","" Marketing""]","[""Assistant Product Manager at Qobuz (Sep 2023 - Present) "",""Product Manager at VITIPACT (Jul 2022 - Jul 2023) "",""Founder at LeadUp Agency (Nov 2021 - Feb 2023)""]","[""Formation Product Manager"","" Product Management at OpenClassrooms (Sep 2023 - Sep 2025) "",""Master Blockchain & Web3"","" Blockchain & Web3 at Founderz (Feb 2023 - Jun 2023) "",""Bachelor"","" Business Administration at Montpellier Management (Sep 2019 - Jul 2022)""]",15,"[""""]","[""companies: Google and Globant"","" groups: Product Managers Community and Developers"","" Engineers & Blockchain Minded People 🚀"","" schools: Product School and OpenClassrooms"","" influencers: Chloe Shih and Julie Zhuo""]",2024-09-04 13:05:03.278488+00,2024-10-26 14:11:05.829+00,,2.3461207,48.8763337,https://ik.imagekit.io/libralab/AAA/Avatars/Map/mathiasboulanger

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mb-simpson/,done,Mike Simpson,https://ik.imagekit.io/libralab/AAA/Avatars/mb-simpson,Founder,Stratagic,https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratagic/,https://www.stratagic.com.au,"Queenscliff, New South Wales, Australia | AU",mike@stratagic.com.au,,"With close to a decade of experience in Strata and Body Corporate Management, I am dedicated to providing solutions to improve the delivery of Strata Management. As the founder of Stratagic Pty Ltd, I bring a unique approach, combining industry expertise with cutting-edge AI tools to simplify, automate and improve the ""Strata"" experience for Strata Managers, Strata Owners, Strata Residents and Strata Services Providers.

What I Bring to the Table:

Automated Communication and Engagement:
Effective communication is the backbone of any successful Strata Manager. With custom built AI-tools, I assist Strata Managers in automating routine communication and auto-drafting complex email responses and interactions. and providing easy to access instant relevant information for managers, owners and residents.

Customised integrations
We customise the solutions to fit within your existing technology infrastructure. Instead of trying to change the method for owners to contact their manager (e.g. log into an owners portal, raise a job ticket etc), we stick to the ways they want to communication with their manager. Further Managers won't have to add yet another dashboard/ page etc to have open to do their work - we stick with what the manager wants. 95% of written communication is received via email in Outlook? We'll create a tool that will read your Outlook emails, and draft responses to the email in Outlook ready for you to review, make a tweak or two, then hit the send button.

Procedures, best practice guides etc
Strata Management is complex. Strata Managers need to be across countless Acts, internal procedure guides/ best practice guidelines and building specific preferences. Imagine the possibilities of having a trusted chat agent with all of this information on hand. All you need to do is ask the question and everything is at your finger tips.

My Mission at Stratagic:
Stratagic Pty Ltd was founded with a vision to modernise and enhance the Strata experience through the intelligent integration of AI solutions. Lets be more Strategic with Strata.

If you’re interested in exploring how AI can transform your strata operations or if you need guidance on compliance, community management, or proactive solutions, give me a shout.

Together, we can pioneer a smarter approach to strata management.","[""{\""name\"":\""Legislation\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Chatbot Development\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Generative AI Tools\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Creativity and Innovation\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Networking\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Consulting\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Customer Experience\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Communication\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Planning\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Collaborative Problem Solving\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Budgeting\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Energy Markets\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Product Innovation\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Operations Management\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Product Management\"",\""endorsements\"":21}"",""{\""name\"":\""Innovation Management\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Problem Solving\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Renewable Energy\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Leadership\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Data Analysis\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Change Management\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Analytical Skills\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Team Management\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Team Leadership\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Product Marketing\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Product Launch\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Negotiation\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Marketing\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Competitive Analysis\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Entrepreneurship\"",\""endorsements\"":28}"",""{\""name\"":\""Small Business\"",\""endorsements\"":16}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Innovation\"",\""endorsements\"":13}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Strategy\"",\""endorsements\"":16}"",""{\""name\"":\""Real Estate\"",\""endorsements\"":10}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Process Improvement\"",\""endorsements\"":4}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Administration\"",\""endorsements\"":5}"",""{\""name\"":\""Research & Analysis\"",\""endorsements\"":2}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Development\"",\""endorsements\"":4}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Management\"",\""endorsements\"":3}"",""{\""name\"":\""Microsoft Office\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Microsoft Excel\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Microsoft Word\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Microsoft Outlook\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""WordPress\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Strategic Planning\"",\""endorsements\"":3}"",""{\""name\"":\""Public Speaking\"",\""endorsements\"":10}"",""{\""name\"":\""Management\"",\""endorsements\"":8}"",""{\""name\"":\""Critical Thinking\"",\""endorsements\"":2}"",""{\""name\"":\""Relationship Development\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Attention to Detail\"",\""endorsements\"":2}""]","[""{\""title\"":\""Founder\"",\""company\"":\""Stratagic\"",\""date_range\"":\""Aug 2024 -

My goal is to help business owners and entrepreneurs capitalize on AI by designing custom solutions with 1-on-1 collaboration. 

By wisely introducing AI into your company, you will effectively place yourself ahead of all those who remain unaware of the new paradigm following the rise of ChatGPT.

Whether or not you're familiar with AI automation, you've likely wondered, ""What's the point of any of this? How does it directly affect businesses and entrepreneurs?""

Well, many businesses that continue to focus on manual operations open themselves up to a massive blindspot—the limits of human scalability. To remedy this issue, I'll work with you to ""inject"" AI into strategic positions within your business so you can reserve human employees for only the most vital tasks. If you decide to grow with AI, prepare to:

→ Employ custom systems with superhuman efficiency
→ Save time, money, and stress by automating repetitive tasks
→ Boost client satisfaction with round-the-clock support and communication 
→ Optimize internal productivity for management, owners, and employees 
→ Effortlessly process data, manage projects, and communicate with clients

If you're like most businesses, you're overwhelmed by AI and reluctant to dive in, yet you nonetheless see what processes and issues continue to consume your precious time. 

It doesn’t have to be this way, as my intention is to create fully customized AI solutions that transform the way businesses work.

Here’s My 5-Step Strategy:

1. Evaluate your current workflows.
2. Uncover any pain points or inefficiencies.
3. Determine if AI can fill the role.
4. Distill the task into clear steps.
5. Design you a custom automated solution(s).

More employees or overtime hours will not achieve what I aim to accomplish for you. 

I'll do my best to make AI as simple and easy for you as possible—rest assured that you can leave all the technical work to me. Here's what you can expect:

→ 1-on-1 consulting and direct collaboration 
→ A custom set of reliable, unique AI systems with no usage limits
→ Continued support for ongoing growth and improvement 
→ Integration of the most cutting-edge GPT and Claude models

You're one message away from making this happen. Reach out directly to me, and we'll make sure you join the top 1% of business owners looking to capitalize on this opportunity.","[""Content Strategy"","" Copywriting"","" Digital Strategy"","" Process Automation"","" Online Content Creation"","" Large Language Models (LLM)"","" Generative AI Tools"","" AI Solutions"","" AI Productivity"","" Workflow Automation"","" Business Process Automation"","" Content Development"","" Social Media"","" Video Production"","" Artificial Intelligence (AI)""]","[""LLM Trainer & Performance Evaluator at Scale AI (Apr 2024 - Present) "",""Content Creator at Self-employed (Mar 2020 - Jan 2022) -""]","[""-""]",0,"[""""]","[""companies: Oregon State University and LinkedIn News"","" schools: Oregon State University"","" influencers: Andrew Huberman and Lex Fridman""]",2024-08-25 04:56:50.511072+00,2024-10-26 14:12:40.154+00,2ab29441-65dc-495d-bcd6-b7eb6bf7a159,-121.3153096,44.0581728,https://ik.imagekit.io/libralab/AAA/Avatars/Map/mike-seitz-863744303

In particular, in these areas:

➡️ Lead generation and client acquisition
➡️ Customer experience
➡️ Operational processes
➡️ Content creation

My journey to where I am today has been quite interesting. From living and teaching in Japan to managing high-stakes casino games and pro sports trading, and then on to 10+ years in digital marketing.

During my career in digital marketing, I've worked with some of the world's leading performance marketing networks, including A4D, Perform[cb], Max Bounty, ClickDealer and companies that include DJI, Bowflex and Netflix.

In 2022, I started working with automation and AI to build systems that could deliver optimal results. Today, the services I offer combine my extensive digital experience with deep knowledge of the ever-evolving technological landscape.

My mission is to help businesses experience the significant benefits that AI and automation offers, in terms of:

– revenue growth
– speed, efficiency and productivity
– quality of service
– scalability
– job satisfaction and employee engagement

AI and automation can help businesses of all sizes. Those that implement AI in their workflows get more done in less time. Those that are slow to adapt are already being left behind.

It's 2024 and cold emails are not what they once were.

You need a much more tailored, targeted approach with with things like
->Scraping your own lists 
->personalization with AI
->Segmentation
->A/Z Testing
->Behavioral Triggers
->Automations
->Timing and Frequency
->Analytics and Metrics
->Sub Sequences
->Deliverability Management
->Account/Domain Rotations
->Relevancy

We do that for you.

By hiring someone that actually knows what works allows you to skips a multiple month long learning curve and allows you to get results right away.


How does it work? 
-> We understand your Business (Solution, Offer, Audience)
--> Research your target Industry (Industry trends, competitors, ICP)
---> Scrape and Personalize lists with AI (Based on what we've learned from the research)
----> Write emails 
-----> Deliver results

------> Constant improvement and testing for better results.

In a nutshell :)




Here's what some of our clients say

Humza Ahmed - Founder&CEO @automaxAI
""Nico helped me going from no clients or meetings to constantly booking 7-8 meetings a week and closing my first 5 clients in 2 weeks!""

Ali Shah - Founder/CEO @Onetelos UK
""I used to have 0.4% reply rate on 40k emails where all response were ""Blocked"" or ""No"" 
After a 30min call with Nico, it instantly went to 5%""

Etem Kaylon - Founder/CEO @Kagency
""My cold E-mail outreach got to the point where they are so interested in a call that they avoid replying to my competitors.""



For the past 3+ years, I've sent over 4 million emails, personally coached over 200 business owners in cold emailing techniques, and currently serve as the outreach coach for the world's largest AI education community.






There's 2 scenarios from you booking in a call:

A: You like it and we can explore this further.

B: You don't like it and walk away with an understanding of what other AI companies are doing to succeed with cold emails.

I’m currently geeking out on GPT and chatbot development, creating tools that not only work but feel intuitive and human—like my Career Growth Advisor GPT, which offers personalized career guidance powered by AI. As part of the Google Developer Program, I’m sharpening my skills with Gemini, OpenAI’s API, and staying ahead of the curve with emerging models like Claude. My goal is to build, teach, and lead in the AI space, turning complex technology into tools that anyone can use to drive their business forward.

I’m also an advocate for transparent and ethical AI implementations. I’m continuously expanding my expertise, aiming to contribute thought leadership on how AI can enhance both societal and business outcomes.

• Spending extra free time (and money) whichever way they'd like

What does this look like for you?

As CEO, I restructured family-owned business into a corporate management hierarchy, resulting in 2x+ company size & revenue, reducing waste & increasing margins. The company realized a complete financial reversal into profitability & sustainability. Now a recognized top producer in the industry, my team developed a cost-saving business model that significantly diminished competition.

A culture of collaboration, commitment and creativity was implemented. Financial KPIs were normalized into predictability. Margins were increased by over 20%. Raw material waste was reduced by 30%. Prior concurrent losses were reversed into profitability in my 3rd year as CEO.

I am very fortunate to have the opportunity to have supported this team of talented and passionate people in success. Today, while they handle operations, I work the finance side to protect and improve profit & sustainability.

Who We Help:
We’re all about supporting insurance agents and brokers who are working tirelessly to grow their businesses and serve their clients better.

The Problem We Solve:
Let’s face it, in the insurance biz, missing client calls is like kryptonite – it means missed opportunities and, well, stress snack attacks. The traditional methods of handling these calls just don’t cut it anymore.

How We Solve It:
That’s where our AI Voice Agents and Automated Assistants come in. Imagine having a super reliable assistant that handles client calls 24/7, never takes a lunch break, and never needs a coffee refill. Yep, that’s what our AI does!

Back in my day, if you missed a call, you could almost hear the faint sound of a commission flying away. But now, with our AI handling calls, no more missed opportunities means more signed policies and happier clients.

What Does This Mean for You?
Boost in Client Response Rate: We’re talking about ensuring that every single client call gets answered. This translates to up to 30% more customer interactions.
Increased Sales Opportunities: With every call answered, you’re looking at a potential 20% rise in new policy sign-ups.
Peace of Mind: Knowing that no client call goes unanswered means you can focus on what really matters – building relationships and closing deals.
Why Pimlico Services?
We’ve been around the block long enough to see technology transform industries. We don’t just follow trends; we set them. Our deep experience combined with our innovative spirit means we’re here to help you thrive in the modern insurance landscape.

Fun Fact:
Remember the days when mobile phones were the size of bricks? Back then, the thought of AI handling client calls was pure sci-fi. Today, it’s our day-to-day reality, and it could be yours too.

Feel like chatting more about how AI can supercharge your insurance business? Let’s grab a virtual coffee and dive in!

What if professional practice owners could clone their best employees?
We haven’t figured that part out just yet, but we’ve created powerful solutions that can help you achieve the next best thing.

At Wisdom Stream AI, we work with high-achieving professional practice owners to automate routine workflows, capture more leads, and increase revenue. Our goal is to help you reclaim valuable time and reduce the friction costs that slow your growth.

Who We Are:
AI will be instrumental in transforming law, accounting, and dental practices in the coming decades. While AI won’t replace professionals, those who embrace its power will outpace their competition. This insight stems from my decade of experience as a practicing attorney, where I’ve witnessed how leveraging technology can turn a small professional practice into a modern powerhouse.

At Parikh Law, P.A., we’ve represented over 3,000 clients since 2019, delivering high-powered legal services across Florida. This success revealed a critical gap in professional practices: the need for intelligent automation that enhances efficiency without sacrificing the personal touch.

Who We Serve:
We help high-achieving professionals in legal, accounting, and dental practices who want to:

Reclaim hours spent on repetitive tasks
Convert more website visitors into loyal clients
Grow revenue without increasing overhead or compromising quality.

How We Do It:
At Wisdom Stream AI, we’ve developed custom AI solutions that transformed our own law practice. Now, we’re bringing these innovations to professional practices like yours. Here’s how we can help:

AI-Powered Virtual Assistants for client communication (chat and voice)
Automated Workflow Systems for backend operations
Lead Generation and Conversion Optimization to maximize your marketing efforts
Client Scheduling and Follow-Up Automation to ensure no lead slips through the cracks
And much more

Our clients consistently report significant improvements in efficiency, revenue, and client satisfaction.

“Our business was missing out on over 300 leads per weekend before we implemented our new AI agents.” - Orlando Flight School

“I used to set aside 4pm to 9pm to handle calls from our canvassing crews. Now they just ask the WhatsApp bot Wisdom Stream built for us. I have my evenings back, and the crews receive consistent, high-quality training.” - Al Moses, Home Makeover Systems

I enjoy making genuine connections with people from all walks of life. I love people and learning their stories. So, here is a little bit of mine.

I love food, animals, and traveling; I am currently writing this from Bali with a dog asleep on my lap and monkeys playing in the trees. 

I graduated Summa Cum Lauda with a 4.0 with a double major and minor while working 4 jobs. When I put my mind to something, there is no stopping me.

I find passion and purpose through service to others. Making a difference is a driving force in all that I do. Through my career, I've worked with a variety of industries and organization that have fueled that very passion.

I have over 15 years experience in communications, business development, coaching, public speaking, fundraising, mentorship, and leadership development. All of these experiences have made me a well rounded leader with an ability to connect quickly and easily with others and spot crucial details most tend to overlook.

In addition to managing multi-million dollar accounts as a Business Development Director for a variety of financial and medical service firms, I continued my dedication to humanitarian services. As part of a surgical team, working with Smile Train and Surgical Volunteers International, I traveled to impoverished countries assisting in free cleft lip and palate and burn reconstruction surgeries on children.

As an international spokesperson and ambassador for the ALS United, I've traveled the world raising awareness and funds for ALS. As the host of Season's Sunflower Hour, a live streaming internet show, we tell the untold stories of the ALS community. 

If that weren't enough to keep me busy, I added pageantry to the mix. Through these experiences, I developed a tireless work ethic, strong public presentation skills, and a keen eye for the perfect image. I was blessed to hold numerous titles and awards within the Miss International, Miss America, and Miss USA system. I've also enjoyed coaching for a variety of local, state, and national pageants. I derive immense pleasure from continuing to help mold girls into confident, polished competitors. 

In addition to coaching young women into top performers, I am passionate about coaching professionals on their image, public speaking skills, and their social media strategy. I will help you perfect your outer game to ensure that you're presenting the very best version of yourself to the world.

Los! Fertig.
Erfolgreich mit kleinen Teams: Wir erarbeiten Lösungen, um mit kleinen Teams erfolgreich zu sein.
Warum arbeite ich immer per Du? Ich habe in den USA gelebt. Und ich treibe viel Sport. Immer habe ich das Du schätzen gelernt. Es macht fast alles leichter und überwindet Grenzen.

Welche Probleme wir lösen:
=====================

1️⃣ Teamflow: Zu wenig ""Flow"" im Team
Lösung: Wir optimieren gemeinsam Prozesse, definieren (Teil-)Ziele und sorgen dafür, dass jeder im Team zu jeder Zeit den „Spielstand“ kennt.

2️⃣ Manpower: Zu wenig Leute
Lösung: Wir automatisieren zeitaufwendige Tätigkeiten und beschaffen kurzfristig Personal mit den erforderlichen Fähigkeiten.

3️⃣ Auslastung: Zu geringe Aufträge
Lösung: Wir optimieren das Angebot Ihres Unternehmens und bauen ein funktionierendes Vertriebskonzept auf.

4️⃣ Cashflow: Zu wenig verfügbares Geld
Lösung: Wir sorgen für pünktliche Zahlung und beschaffen passende Fördermittel, um Projektkosten mit deutlich weniger Eigenmitteln zu finanzieren.

Unsere Dienstleistungen:
===================

Wir sorgen dafür, dass sich wichtige, aber zeitraubende Alltagsaufgaben wieder leicht anfühlen. :
➡️ Dokumentation wichtiger Ziele und notwendiger Prozesse für mehr Klarheit bei jedem Einzelnen
➡️ (Teil-)Automatisierung regelmäßiger wichtiger Aufgaben
➡️ Recruiting neuer Mitarbeiter - als Übergangslösung oder als dauerhafte Teammitglieder
➡️ Aufbau eines funktionierenden Ansprache- und Vertriebskonzepts zur Gewinnung von Wunschkunden
➡️ Beschaffung passender Fördermittel inkl. erforderlicher Anträge und Dokumentation 

Ergebnisse:
=========

➡️  Weniger „tote“ Zeit und Leerlauf im Team
➡️  Ausreichend produktive Teammitglieder
➡️  fortlaufende und planbare Kundengewinnung
➡️  Das gute Gefühl, mal etwas vom Staat ausbezahlt zu bekommen

Warum mit uns arbeiten?
===================

👟 Schnell: Wir arbeiten komplett digital und kommen ohne langes Briefing aus. Daher sind wir schon fertig, wenn andere erst das Projekt aufgesetzt haben. 
🎁 Bezahlbar: Wir arbeiten mit Pauschalhonoraren und nutzen geeigneter Fördermittel. Daherfliegen unsere Preise 50-80% unter denen anderer Anbieter.
📈Erfahrung: Alles, was wir anbieten, haben wir in unseren eigenen Unternehmen erprobt. Wir wissen aus der eigenen Praxis, was läuft und wo Schwierigkeiten lauern.","[""{\""name\"":\""Strategieberatung\"",\""endorsements\"":10}"",""{\""name\"":\""Entwicklung von Geschäftsmodellen\"",\""endorsements\"":6}"",""{\""name\"":\""EKS\"",\""endorsements\"":4}"",""{\""name\"":\""Service-DNA\"",\""endorsements\"":5}"",""{\""name\"":\""Abschlussquote verdoppeln\"",\""endorsements\"":2}"",""{\""name\"":\""Alleinstellungsmerkmale definieren\"",\""endorsements\"":2}"",""{\""name\"":\""USP\"",\""endorsements\"":3}"",""{\""name\"":\""Vertriebsmodelle\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Empfehlungsmarketing\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Kooperationsmarketing\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Akzeptanztest\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Projektmanagement\"",\""endorsements\"":25}"",""{\""name\"":\""Unternehmensführung\"",\""endorsements\"":5}"",""{\""name\"":\""Unternehmertum\"",\""endorsements\"":31}"",""{\""name\"":\""Strategisches Management\"",\""endorsements\"":5}"",""{\""name\"":\""Strategy\"",\""endorsements\"":6}"",""{\""name\"":\""Unternehmensberatung\"",\""endorsements\"":8}"",""{\""name\"":\""Unternehmensstrategie\"",\""endorsements\"":27}"",""{\""name\"":\""Management Consulting\"",\""endorsements\"":5}"",""{\""name\"":\""Entrepreneurship\"",\""endorsements\"":7}"",""{\""name\"":\""Marketing\"",\""endorsements\"":26}"",""{\""name\"":\""Start-ups\"",\""endorsements\"":24}"",""{\""name\"":\""Neugeschäftsentwicklung\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Coaching\"",\""endorsements\"":21}"",""{\""name\"":\""Social Media\"",\""endorsements\"":4}"",""{\""name\"":\""Marketingstrategie\"",\""endorsements\"":8}"",""{\""name\"":\""Project Management\"",\""endorsements\"":3}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Development\"",\""endorsements\"":4}"",""{\""name\"":\""Strategische Planung\"",\""endorsements\"":7}"",""{\""name\"":\""Management\"",\""endorsements\"":2}"",""{\""name\"":\""Business Strategy\"",\""endorsements\"":4}"",""{\""name\"":\""Veränderungsmanagement\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Neukundengewinnung\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Beantragung Fördermittel\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Geschäftsmodellentwicklung\"",\""endorsements\"":2}"",""{\""name\"":\""Kundenakquise\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Wunschkunden\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""Geschäftsmodelle\"",\""endorsements\"":0}"",""{\""name\"":\""business development\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""business modelling\"",\""endorsements\"":1}"",""{\""name\"":\""Strategie\"",\""endorsements\"":0}""]","[""{\""title\"":\""Geschäftsführer\"",\""company\"":\""Brain2 GmbH\"",\""date_range\"":\""Mar 2020 - Present\""}"",""{\""title\"":\""Autor\"",\""company\"":\""Wunschkundenbusiness\"",\""date_range\"":\""Nov 2014 - Present\""}"",""{\""title\"":\""Geschäftsführer\"",\""company\"":\""ADLX GmbH\"",\""date_range\"":\""2008 - Present\""}""]",[],0,"[""Erfolgreich mit kleinen Teams: Wir erarbeiten Lösungen, um mit kleinen Teams erfolgreich zu sein."",""Optimierung von Teamprozessen und Definition von Zielen für besseren Teamflow."",""Automatisierung zeitaufwendiger Tätigkeiten und kurzfristige Personalbeschaffung."",""Optimierung des Unternehmensangebots und Aufbau eines Vertriebskonzepts."",""Beschaffung von Fördermitteln zur Finanzierung von Projektkosten."",""Entwicklung von Neugier-Marketing-Konzepten bei ADLX GmbH."",""Full-Service Beschaffung von Fördermitteln bei Brain2 GmbH."",""Autor des Buches WUNSCH.KUNDEN.BUSINESS zur Entwicklung des perfekten Angebots.""]","[""Marketing"",""Business Development"",""Teamflow Optimization"",""Process Automation"",""Recruitment"",""Sales Strategy"",""Funding Acquisition"",""Jena"",""Schifferstadt""]",2024-11-23 19:46:19.753041+00,2024-12-18 06:53:48.467+00,,11.5892372,50.927054,https://ik.imagekit.io/libralab/AAA/Avatars/Map/steffen-adler-9573a644

These projects have been private/public sector and included both private cloud installations and public cloud transformation or a mix of both. Most projects included a wrapped managed service or service take on objective.

I am a dynamic, detail-oriented professional. My track record demonstrates continued success in conceptualising objectives and strategies for the implementation of innovative solutions while optimising existing systems, applications, and information.

Clients and colleagues know me as a motivational, influential leader and collaborator who excels in cultivating positive customer relationships with the keen ability to define and translate organisational needs into actionable solutions. As an out-of-the-box thinker, I’m dedicated to determining technology insertion points to ensure the consistency of technology with unique projects, including protection, reliability, and scalability needs.

A few of my career highlights include:

•	Led a large digital transformation project for a multi-national legal firm by defining business objectives and assessing technology infrastructure/business processes.
•	Directed large-scale greenfield cloud implementation for a new financial services company breakaway from Grant Thornton, winning the Global Microsoft award and saving the company 250 man-hours every day.
•	Executed a private cloud refresh for the DoJ (a multiyear engagement and a big/complex project).  
•	Operated as the company owner with 25 staff, £3M in turnover by serving enterprise customers, getting onto the Deloitte Fast 50 twice (10th and 12th places) and accomplishing Global Microsoft Award for one of the digital transformation projects.

In my free time, I research about emerging Technologies and the crypto market, read books, travel and exercise.

I look forward to meeting you! You can send me a DM here.

1. Start my own business
2. Move from my comfortable life in Amsterdam to become a digital nomad
3. Quit my comfortable 9 - 5 job at Deloitte
4. Join the team of AAA Accelerator, the biggest AI Educational Community in the world

Maybe you’ve noticed I mention “comfort” multiple times - that’s intentional. Let me use the following quote to explain:

“Growth is painful. Change is painful. But nothing is as painful as staying stuck somewhere you don't belong.”

None of these changes were easy. Fear of the unknown, fear of “what will everyone think."" ... Stepping out of the comfort zone took a lot of contemplation, strategic planning, and courage.

Yet, in July 2024, I accomplished all my goals, and I’m happier than ever.

But I’m not here to speak on personal growth (even though that’s something I’m very passionate about). Change must happen in various areas. And one of them is also business. 

As the world changes, so should business. With AI becoming democratized, I believe it’s crucial for businesses of all sizes to adopt it.

But … AI is complex, overwhelming, and confusing. Staying in your comfort zone and doing what you did before would be easy. But is your business going to reach all the potential it could? 

I don’t think so.

That’s why I’m currently building The AI Leadership Forum, where we help business owners become the leaders in AI Adoption through educational material, advisory services, and connections with our AI ecosystem.

And what makes me qualified to do so? 

I’m not here to claim I’m an AI expert. I know there are many people who know more than me. But here’s a couple of facts:

In the past 7 years, I’ve been in the AI space, gaining theoretical and practical knowledge while obtaining my BSc & MSc degrees, working on 30+ AI projects, and developing enterprise AI solutions at Deloitte for 4 years. 

I’ve also recently joined the team of the biggest AI Educational Community in the world, where I’ve had the honor of coaching over 100 individuals in building AI solutions via 1:1 development coaching and hosting educational workshops. 

For the rest of 2024, I’ll focus on creating educational materials on AI for The AI Leadership Forum, which will help business owners navigate the AI world. I’ll also be looking for speaking opportunities to spread my message even further (if you have any opportunities, please reach out via DM!)

Finally - this story focuses on business, but I’d like to relate to everyone here and leave you with my final message:

We're proud to serve a network of global and domestic clients.

I help brands and organisations create, develop and manage successful digital strategies with longevity.

A well established creative, I'm deeply passionate about crafting visually compelling stories with impact. Being a rare hybrid Photographer, Videographer and Drone Pilot with highly regarded skills in Editing and Post-Production means I'm proficient behind the camera and the editing screen. This results in a number of local and international clients entrusting me with their creative vision to bring their projects to life.

AI is here and it’s here to stay - we understand this. Which is why we build and implement AI automations into businesses to increase their productivity and efficiency. Work smarter, not harder.

I was previously employed with Cook Islands Tourism as a Digital Marketing Coordinator. My time here provided the perfect platform to expand my skillset, adding over 6 years of invaluable experience to my arsenal.

The result? I eventually left my career in the public sector and established TaysMedia to help people more directly.

Master it, and you’ll achieve more than you ever thought possible (in a fraction of the time). 

Most businesses are lagging behind because leaders and employees see AI as a threat.

But if you ARE willing to embrace AI?

You have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to outstrip the competition and achieve success. 

Here's the problem:

- You don’t know what tools are best for your business.
- Your team members lack the knowledge and experience to SAVE time with AI.
- You haven't got time to devise your own training plan or build custom solutions.

As a result, you’re barely scratching the surface of AI’s ability to transform your earnings.

Want to stop wasting time on repetitive tasks and allow your team to reach their full potential?

I can help.

I’m on a mission to help business leaders and their teams embrace AI and reap its benefits.

I offer three services to achieve this: training, custom AI solutions, and consultancy.

🎓 AI-First Training

Transform your team’s productivity and innovation with my 12-week training program.

Through customized interactive sessions, practical workshops, and activities, I’ll equip your employees with the knowledge and skills to understand and leverage AI tools across their work and adopt an AI-first mindset for any task and project.

The result?

Your team members will become AI champions who are always seeking ways to be more efficient and improve the quality of their work.

🛠️ Custom AI Solutions

I build made-to-measure solutions to automate repetitive tasks and increase efficiency. 

Whether your looking for a personalized AI strategy or cutting-edge tools, I've got you covered. You’ll see efficiency soar, and employees will report higher job satisfaction. With repetitive tasks automated, everyone can focus on creative and rewarding work.

💬 AI Consultancy

Through my AI consultancy, I advise business leaders about what’s possible with AI. 

Through brainstorming and problem-solving sessions, we’ll build a company-wide AI strategy to make you highly competitive in an AI-first world.

The AI revolution has begun. 

Don’t get left behind.

Do you have leaders who are experts in their technical field but lack leadership skills to engage their teams?

Are you struggling to develop your bench strength?

(L&D, OD, TM, & HR professionals, keep reading)

We help HR teams scale leadership ability while improving people metrics & organizational results.

But what we really do is provide time back to busy HR teams -- so they can spend more time working on the CHRO’s most important initiatives.

In 30 days, your leaders install the Leader Operating System (LeaderOS) by learning how to create clarity, build alignment and generate movement on key goals.

Here’s how our proven program, “Lead In 30”, works:

1️⃣ Performance Alignment: Align your organization’s leadership development with your key organizational outcomes. These might include financial metrics, employee engagement, safety, etc. This alignment will show a clear return on investment.

2️⃣ Scalable Development: Develop leadership cohorts of up to 1000 leaders at once. This helps your leadership pool grow quickly. Even if you have limits like budget, size, time, or remote/hybrid workforce.

3️⃣ Layered Learning: This helps with retention & practical use. We use a multi-layered learning approach. It includes live web classes, on-demand video lessons, A.I., & interactive huddles. The cadence repeats over four weeks.

Jeg er grunnleggeren bak AI Automatisering, et selskap som har som mål å gjøre kunstig intelligens (AI) tilgjengelig og forståelig for bedriftsledere. Min lidenskap er å vise hvordan AI kan brukes for å gi bedrifter et forsprang i en stadig mer konkurransepreget verden. Ved å bryte ned de tekniske barrierene, hjelper jeg ledere med å se klare muligheter for hvordan AI kan forbedre deres virksomhet.

Jeg er alltid på utkikk etter nye muligheter til å hjelpe flere bedrifter med å oppdage hvordan AI kan gjøre dem mer innovative og konkurransedyktige. Hvis du er nysgjerrig på AI og ønsker å utforske hva det kan gjøre for din bedrift, ville jeg elsket å høre fra deg. La oss sammen utforske hvordan vi kan bruke AI til å skape nye muligheter for din virksomhet.
